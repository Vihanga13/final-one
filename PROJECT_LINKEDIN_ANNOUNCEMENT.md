✅ Successfully Completed My Final Year Project! 🎓  
I'm excited to announce the successful completion of my final year project:

📌📌AI-Powered Fitness & Nutrition Assistant Mobile App📌📌

This project addresses the growing need for accessible, intelligent health management by empowering users to track fitness goals, analyze meals, and receive personalized wellness insights—all through a modern, cross-platform mobile application.

🚀 What I Built:  
A real-time, cross-platform mobile app using Flutter (Dart) with Firebase integration for authentication, storage, and data management. The app features a custom-trained AI model (PyTorch, Python) deployed via a REST API, enabling users to scan meals for instant nutritional analysis and recommendations.

🧠 AI & Data Intelligence Features:  
1. 📸 Meal image recognition and nutritional analysis using a deep learning model  
2. 🧪 Model development in Python (PyTorch), deployed with Flask  
3. 🔗 Secure API integration for real-time AI predictions  
4. 📊 Personalized dashboards for BMI, goal tracking, and meal history  
5. 🔒 Firebase Authentication for secure, role-based access

🔧 Tech Stack & Tools:  
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart), Material Design  
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)  
- AI Model: Python (PyTorch), Flask API  
- Data Visualization: Custom Flutter widgets  
- Image Processing: image_picker, camera  
- Security: Firebase Auth, environment-based API key management  
- Others: REST API, Cloud Storage, Postman

🔁 Core Modules Include:  
- 🏋️ Fitness goal selection & progress tracking  
- 📸 Meal scanning with AI-powered recognition  
- 📊 BMI calculation & analytics dashboard  
- 🗂️ User profile & secure authentication  
- 💬 AI Chatbot for health and nutrition advice

📲 What’s Next?  
Plans include deploying the app to app stores, expanding AI capabilities for broader food recognition, and integrating wearable device support for holistic health tracking.
